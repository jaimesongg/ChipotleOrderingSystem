Project: Chipotle Ordering System

Description: 
The goal of this project was to create a simulation of a Chipotle ordering system using object-oriented programming in Java. The assignment involves building two classes to represent essential objects within the system, likely including classes for items such as Burritos, ingredients, or orders. The primary focus is on creating these classes with appropriate attributes and methods to model real-world interactions accurately. Additionally, the assignment requires implementing a Driver class to demonstrate the functionality of the created classes by creating multiple orders for Burritos, showcasing how the system would work in practice.
